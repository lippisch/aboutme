  title: Director, IT Shared Services
  info: 
    - Led a global delivery organization providing shared services to other teams, such as DevOps Center of Excellence, Enterprise Integration, API Governance, and others. Fostered a culture of modern agile DevOps teams, delivering value continuously, experimenting and learning rapidly, with safety as a prerequisite, to make people awesome.
    - Defined and implemented software engineering best practices, combining an agile Kanban process, fully automated CI/CD pipelines and a cloud-native architecture framework to modernize the custom application landscape.
    - The framework included a collection of open-source technologies, architectural patterns, and training. This enabled development teams to migrate legacy applications on to a containerized, microservice environment providing APIâ€™s as a service to other teams. Effectively reducing release cycle time to weekly or less, increasing stability and reducing operational cost.
    - Successfully implemented a new enterprise integration strategy using Kafka and microservices, for high performance data integration. In our first use-case, an integration between Oracle CPQ and Snowflake, the throughput was increased by 10x and operating cost was significantly reduced compared to the legacy integration.
